# youtube-dl-kiss-ui

A simple Web UI to download Video/Sound from youtube and others platforms. NOT a download manager (you can use Aria or others !).

If possible, it will stream directly from Youtube (or others websites) to your browser, else will download the file and stream to your browser. In this last case, the browser can wait a long time before receive data (can be a problem with big videos ?).

Uses yt-dlp, and updates it each day
